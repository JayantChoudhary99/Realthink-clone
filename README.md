# Realthink-clone
This repository contains a clone of the RealThink website, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases my front-end development skills and includes a responsive design optimized for various screen sizes, including desktop (max-width: 1040px) and mobile (max-width: 440px) views.
